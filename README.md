# Just-before-int 

• just int unless you want to.

• i don't support racists,bullies, fake friends and all. you disgust me. 

ppl under 12 unless you been friends with me before i even started this Github

lookie here i seen ppl just ignoring new players but we could try to int with them to show how the game is? but iets try to int with them.

but beware of weirdos because ime tell you something.
Some new player needed friends so i added them. wanna know what they did? they whispered me smtg, quite weird.

"don't worry" then again "don't worry baby'.

i removed them. i saw them asking other new ppl and that player firstly asked their age,gender and specially asked if they were a girl.
thank you for reading this whatsoever readme
